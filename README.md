# 🔒 UNSW_NB15 Cybersecurity Threat Detection - ANN

Welcome to the **UNSW_NB15 Cybersecurity Threat Detection - ANN** repository! This project leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for detecting cybersecurity threats using the **UNSW_NB15 dataset**, a well-known benchmark for network intrusion detection.

## 📌 Project Overview
- 🚀 **AI-Powered Intrusion Detection:** Implements ANN for network attack classification  
- 🔍 **UNSW_NB15 Dataset:** Realistic network traffic simulation with labeled attack types  
- ⚠ **Threat Categorization:** Identifies malware, phishing, DDoS, and anomalous activities  
- 📊 **Feature Engineering:** Uses statistical and machine learning-based feature selection  

## 📂 Data Format
The dataset contains structured network traffic logs with attributes:
- `Timestamp` – Event recording time  
- `Protocol` – Network communication protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)  
- `Source IP` / `Destination IP` – Network endpoints involved in communication  
- `Payload Size` – Data packet size in bytes  
- `Attack Label` – Classification of network behavior (Normal vs. Malicious)  
- `Attack Type` – Specific cyber threat (e.g., DoS, Worms, Backdoors)  

## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository and set up the environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UNSW_NB15-Cybersecurity-ANN.git
cd UNSW_NB15-Cybersecurity-ANN
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 How to Use
- Preprocess the dataset – Normalize network traffic features
- Train the ANN model – Optimize learning parameters for threat classification
- Evaluate accuracy – Compare ANN performance with other models
Example usage in Python:
from model import ANNClassifier

classifier = ANNClassifier("UNSW_NB15.csv")
classifier.train()
predictions = classifier.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
